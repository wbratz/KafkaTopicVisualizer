# Kafka Topic Visualizer

## What is the goal of kafka topic vizualizer?

To easily allow connection to Kafka topics and inspect incoming messages.
Currently Kafka doesn't have a good way to allow developers to view and inspect messages in plain text.

The easy to use UI allows for quick connection. It also allows non developers to connect to topics and verify messages are sent, and inspect their content in plain text.
